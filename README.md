# manifest_generator

## Description
Creates a manifest for Zooniverse project files


## Requirements
Python 3.x


## Run
* Clone or Download to Desktop

* Run script: `python manifest_generator.py`

* You will then be prompted to enter the absolute path to the directory.

* A csv will then be created containing a sequential list of ID numbers and file names, along with their respective column headers.

## Troubleshooting
* If invisible file names turn up in your manifest, use Terminal to delete the file (e.g. `$ rm .DS_Store`). Then start the process over again.
